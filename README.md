# My Project

This is a simple project showcasing the use of HTML and CSS in GitHub README files.

## Introduction

In this project, we demonstrate how to use HTML and CSS to enhance the appearance of your GitHub README.

You can include inline HTML and CSS in your Markdown to style your content. For example:

```html

</div>
```
